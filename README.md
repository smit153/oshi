# Oshi (押し)

A sliding-piece puzzle game inspired by
[Ricochet Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_Robots).

Guide the puck to its destination - but pieces continue until they hit
something.

*Oshi* (押し) means "push" in Japanese.

  without JavaScript
- **Touch & keyboard** — swipe on mobile, arrow-keys or `u`/`r`/`h` shortcuts on
  desktop
- **CSS-only replays** — animated solution playback, no JS animation libraries
- **Smart solver** — BFS-based solver finds optimal solutions and powers the
  hint system

## Editor

The built-in editor lets you create puzzles from scratch or generate random
solvable boards with configurable minimum moves. A debounced solver runs on every
edit, showing the optimal solution length in real time. Use **Download** to
export a puzzle as a `.md` file and **Import** to load one back in.

## Getting Started

Requires [Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).

```bash
# Start dev server with file watching
deno task dev

# Build for production
deno task build

# Preview production build
deno task preview
```

## Project Structure

```
routes/          File-system routes (pages + API)
islands/         Interactive Preact components (hydrated client-side)
components/      Static server-rendered components
game/            Core game logic (board, solver, parser, types, cookies)
client/          Browser-only code (touch, keyboard, routing)
lib/             Portable utilities (env, analytics, replay, build tools)
db/              Deno KV database layer
static/puzzles/  Puzzle definitions in Markdown + ASCII
```

## Puzzle Format

Puzzles are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter and an ASCII board:

```markdown
---
name: My Puzzle
slug: my-puzzle
createdAt: 2025-06-15T00:00:00.000Z
---

+ A B C D E F G H +
1 #     #         |
2   X             |
3    |            |
4                 |
5                 |
6         @       |
7                 |
8 #               |
+-----------------+
```

Symbols: `@` = puck (player piece), `X` = destination, `#` = blocker,
`|` = vertical wall, `_` = horizontal wall.

The easiest way to create a puzzle is via the in-app editor at `/puzzles/new`.
Design your board, then click **Download** to save the `.md` file. Use
**Import** to load it back into the editor later. Place it in
`static/puzzles/` and run `deno task update-puzzles` to register it.
