/**
 * Measures how well the scoring composite tracks human judgement: scores every
 * rated candidate in the store and reports the Spearman correlation between
 * ratings and composite scores, the ordered table (so misplaced boards are
 * visible), and per-metric ρ — the evidence base for promoting or demoting
 * composite terms.
 *
 * Ground truth is the whole rated store: a corpus puzzle rated through
 * `/candidate` is a stored candidate tagged `source: corpus`, so shipped and
 * generated boards carry their ratings in the same place. The separation
 * tables — which metrics split kept boards from rejected ones — go to a report
 * file, being too wide for a terminal.
 *
 * Run after any `CALIBRATION` change. Solves are cached and
 * calibration-independent, so iterations cost seconds.
 *
 * Usage: `deno task check-calibration [outfile] [--timeout=60000]`
