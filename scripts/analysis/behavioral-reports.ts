// ARCHIVED ANALYSIS — not a `deno task`, and not expected to run as-is.
//
// This is the record of one investigation (pull date below), kept for its SQL
// and its method rather than for repeat runs. To redo it: run QUERY in PostHog,
// save the result to the PSV path below, bump PULL_DATE, then
// `deno run -A scripts/analysis/behavioral-reports.ts`.
//
// Its conclusion already landed: `variety` left the composite in calibration
// v5. The reusable part is the adjustment described below — the naive version
// of it was wrong in a way that took a while to find, so it is written down.
//
// Output: `behavioral.json` (slug-keyed cache) plus the too-easy and
// difficulty-mislabel reports, all under the gitignored `scoring/.cache/`.
//
// The adjustment
// --------------
// `optAdj` answers "is this board solved optimally more often than its own
// players manage elsewhere?". For each solve it takes
//     (nailed it here? 1/0) − (how often that player nails it on OTHER boards)
// and averages. The baseline is leave-board-out, so a board never contributes to
// the yardstick it is measured against.
//
// Only players with >= 2 distinct boards have a baseline at all. Solves by
// single-board players are DROPPED, not counted as zero — counting them as zero
// scales the whole signal by each board's linkable share, which varies 10%-70%
// per board and is mostly an artifact of anonymous sessions fragmenting
// `person_id`. That reintroduces exactly the traffic-mix confound the adjustment
// exists to remove. `feN` records how many solves actually back each number.
//
// Estimates are then shrunk toward the corpus mean in proportion to their
// standard error (empirical Bayes), so a board resting on 9 solves is not ranked
// against one resting on 118.

## The signal

- **\`pct_optimal\`** — share of solves that hit exactly minMoves.
- **\`opt_adj\`** — player fixed-effect: the board's optimal rate minus what its own
  players achieve on *other* boards (leave-board-out).
- **\`shrunk\`** — the same estimate pulled toward the corpus mean by its standard
  error. **Rank on this column.**

## Read the fe_n column

\`opt_adj\` can only be computed from solves by players who played more than one
board — \`fe_n\` counts them, and it runs from ${
    Math.min(...rated.map((b) => b.feN))
  } to ${Math.max(...rated.map((b) => b.feN))} across the corpus. The \`solves\`
column is *not* the sample size behind the adjustment.

Anonymous sessions fragment \`person_id\`, so the excluded solves are a mix of
genuine newcomers and returning players wearing a fresh id. That makes this a
statement about linkable sessions, not about "regulars" — a shortlist for human
review, never an autofail.

## Anchors

A de-confounded behavioural difficulty percentile (0 = easiest, 100 = hardest)
built from two shrunk player fixed-effects: \`opt_adj\` (high ⇒ easy) and
\`ratio_adj\` (high ⇒ hard, length-independent). **\`conf\`**: ✓ = both agree;
~ = they disagree (polarising board — many nail it, the rest flail).

**This is a review shortlist, not an autorelabel.** Three limits:
- Section membership is a *percentile cut*, so each list is populated by
  construction — its length is not evidence of that many mislabels.
- It measures "hard to solve on average". Boards whose value is an isolated
  brilliant optimal that players skip for an easier near-miss read as easier than
  they are (torstein).
- Difficulty ≠ quality. malene is easy to solve and still 5★.
