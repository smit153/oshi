 * into both the report body and its filename.
 *
 * v1 used theoretical maxes and came out *anti-correlated* with human judgement
 * — both the rated corpus boards (erik > torstein > kim > malene) and the first
 * labeled generated set (a 2★ board scored top, a 5★ board bottom) inverted.
 *
 * v2 was a conservative structural correction (dropped `firstMovePrecision`,
 * promoted `wallUtilization`/`deadSpace`, added shaped `variety`) tuned on 11
 * labels; the 35-label batch showed it still carried no rank signal (pooled
 * ρ = 0.07).
 *
 * v3 prunes the composite down to the metrics the 39-board labeled set showed
 * actually track ratings (per-metric ρ from `check-calibration`):
 *  - kept: `stopWeighted` (+0.38), `pieceUsage` (+0.27), `wallUtilization`
 *    (+0.19), `reversals` (+0.18), `searchProfile` (+0.12) — the "blockers and
 *    walls actually matter" cluster, matching the dominant human complaints
 *    (obvious solutions, useless blockers, decorative walls);
 *  - kept `variety` on corpus ground truth (the malene profile) despite a flat
 *    ρ in this batch — the generated set barely exercises it;
 *  - dropped `coverage` (−0.22), `crossTrailOverlap` (−0.19), `deception`
 *    (−0.07), `totalDistance` and `setupRatio` (~0) — anti-signal or noise
 *    that diluted the composite as equal-weight positives;
 *  - dropped `deadSpace` from the negatives (raw ρ +0.01 — board economy is
 *    not what the composite is for); kept the two zero-variance penalties as
 *    safety rails against degenerate routes.
 *
 * v4 promoted `clumping` into the negatives: measured on the same labeled set
 * it came out the second-strongest signal overall (ρ = −0.35), confirming the
 * most common human complaint tag.
 *
 * v5 dropped `variety`. Two independent lines condemned it: its rating ρ was ~0
 * (kept in v3 only on the corpus-ground-truth hunch), and PostHog behaviour
 * (player-adjusted optimal-solve rate over 192 corpus boards) showed
 * `uniqueSolutions` tracks *easiness* (ρ +0.18) — so variety was a positive that
 * rewarded easy multi-solution boards while penalising the isolated-brilliant
 * profile (torstein, few solutions). Removing it lifted pooled ρ 0.373 → 0.488
 * and restored the corpus order (malene ≈ torstein ≫ erik > kim). Quality is
 * non-monotonic in solution count (both varied-malene and isolated-torstein are
 * 5★), so the varied side wants a difficulty-gated / U-shaped term, not a naive
 * "more solutions = better" — deferred until such a term is designed and earns
 * its ρ (`nearMissCount`/`isolationGap`, both advisory, are the raw material).
