 * `wallSymmetry`. `ugly` is not just "not pretty": most boards are neither, so
 * a tag that only marks the good ones leaves the bad ones and the unremarkable
 * ones indistinguishable — which is the shape of correlation the metric needs.
 *
 * The list is deliberately short, and every word on it belongs to the board

 * verdict, and a second scale per route would only make "what am I rating?"
 * ambiguous on every click. A route gets labelled, not scored.
 *
 * `too-easy` is the important one. Difficulty is a property of the route a
 * player actually finds, not of the board — the obvious route is the one they
 * take, and a board whose easiest solution is trivial plays trivially however
 * good the others are. Measured against the board it was ambiguous (too easy
 * *for whom*, by which route?), which is why it never correlated; against a
 * single route it's a concrete claim.
 *
 * `boring` is the other half: a route that isn't easy but isn't worth finding
 * either.
 *
 * The two positives are separate on purpose, because they fail separately.
 * `interesting` is about the route as an experience — it does something worth
 * discovering (the composite, `deception`, `reversals`). `unique` is about it
 * being genuinely its own route rather than a reshuffle of another one, which
 * `puckPathVariety` measures: the `birk` case had two 9-move solutions moving
 * the puck along the same path, differing only in the order the blockers got
 * shuffled — reported as two solutions, experienced as one. A route can be
 * interesting without being unique, and unique without being interesting.
 *
 * All four are labels a route-level score can be calibrated against — a route
 * tagged too-easy that the composite scores well is exactly the disagreement
 * worth having on record.
