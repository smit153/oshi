 * generator panel's readout, the corpus and comparison reports, and the
 * calibration tooling — so adding a metric is one edit here rather than five
 * hand-maintained lists that silently drift apart.
 *
 * `aggregate` mirrors `computeMetrics`' reduction: `max` across routes for
 * signals, `min` for the penalties (metrics measured once per board are
 * route-constant, so `max` is a no-op on them). `scope` says which of those two
 * cases a metric is in.
