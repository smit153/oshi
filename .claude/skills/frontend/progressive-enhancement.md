# Progressive enhancement

## Core principle

Progressive enhancement is a core philosophy. Browser-native technology (HTML,
CSS, cookies, headers) is battle-tested by millions of users and developed by
large, smart communities. It forces you to think about a wider set of use cases
and justify custom solutions when a simpler native one exists.

URL-first architecture follows naturally from PE — see architecture/state.md.

## Islands architecture (Fresh 2)

Fresh implements PE through islands: both `components/` and `islands/` are
server-rendered, but islands are also hydrated client-side for interactivity.
The distinction is reactivity, not rendering — an island's initial output still
comes from the server. Put interactivity in islands, static layout in
components. Default to `components/`; only reach for an island when the UI
genuinely needs client-side behaviour. One exception: the editor is inherently
client-side and can rely on it fully.

## HTML forms

Forms are complex and almost unavoidable in modern frontend. Luckily, they work
100% server side and cover a wide variety of validation by default.

## Accessibility

Semantic html is a good way of forcing yourself to think about the purpose of a
bigger piece of ui or even the atomic parts, fx. the kbd element. They bring
excellent a11y out of the box and a multitude of properties.

When semantic HTML isn't enough, ARIA can complement it. Caveat: if an ARIA
component is getting very complex, ask whether it should exist at all — not how
to make it work with ARIA.

Make as much of the interface keyboard-navigable as possible. It enforces good
semantics and ends up helping more users than you'd expect.

## "Use the platform"

Use `<select>` over JS component libraries — it allows custom styling at rest
and falls back to native UI on mobile. Use CSS transforms for animation, not JS
— it's faster and compositor-accelerated.
